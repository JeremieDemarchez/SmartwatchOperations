# SmartwatchOperations
This maven project is used as d√©pendency for the mqtt module in iCasa and in the smartwatch app. It allows to have different interfaces in iCasa and in the smartwatch app by converting a service name in iCasa to a code and retrieve the corresponding service in the watch thanks to the code (and vis-versa).
